here is a glimpse into the living growing stuff- my prime collaborators and companions 

the fishbowl mycelium./ networked fishbowl


the mycelium fibres grew in the powder, and then over the bowl, connecting every bit of food. A young botanist - Jagdish- told me, that th fungi commits sucide after producing spore when it cant find any more nutrition. the organism has to make a choice. 

here, what i find really interesting is that how it teriitorizes space. the scale at which it grows in the medium to cover or 'address' every milimeter square of space- its perception within the bowl is perfect. 

the other interesting thing is that on understanding that there isn't enough food or conditions to grow a fruiting body, it has to make a choice. perhaps it is pre-decided how much substrate would yield a mushroom. some kind of analysis and decision is there in the mycelium.

self organisation in mycelium is so fundamental- so simple one could say- it develops veins to transport water and neutrients within the substrate. just adding
