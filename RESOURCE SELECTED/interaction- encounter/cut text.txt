A butcher shop existed in every small village and town, and men and women went to these shops to buy meat to cook and eat. There is something that happens in a simple act like going to a butcher shop. maybe there is an awareness and acceptance of what it means to eat meat. everything is stil the same, but now we are in a time where a lot of urban youth has been eating meat without that encounter or awareness. assembly line meat products have been in shelves for many years. there is a sudden rise towards veganism as well. and most people advocating it- are these young people who are experiencing this encounter and are appalled by it.
