raspberry pi day two. 

< images in phone >

I had tried to run the pi on a few occasions. problems- NO HDMI monitor, pi not working when i tried with a HDMI to vga converter- with two different converters. it had never been run before. 

attempt two- monday- problem- json could not be found. installation not starting. 

tried formatting the card with the sdcardFormatter- got stuck at 81 percent and got bricked after that. 8 gb card sacrificed.  

tuesday- attempt three- I brought a new card (16gb; 520 rupees), pasted NOOBS on it, and turned on the pi. It worked. 

after installation of raspbian-

installed ssh and get remote accesss from phone in tandem with the screen. have not yet used the phone standalone to use the pi. 

fixed the camera module into the pi. enabled camera from prefrences. rebooted device. opened terminal; command line for taking image- raspistill -o img.jpg.

// the camera is attached to the pi with a small strip- about 8 cm in length. this makes the camera less flexible. 
//since none of the devices are cased and the camera is just flimsy, i needed to make a setup where it could take pictures of what i want it to take pictures of, without me having to hold it. 

wednesday- made a basic setup for the pi cam. 
		tested it with the 60x microscope. it did okay. 
		the image is not that focussed somehow. 
		the circle is present. the camera is wide angle. 
		testing it with lenses. 
		

		figured code for timelapse. 

		need to set the pi and the device near the growing plants now. for that i need to get a monitor or figure something out to be able to run the pi at home. the present option is the phone. But i want a standalone screen. 5inch- 3400; 3.4inch -1200
