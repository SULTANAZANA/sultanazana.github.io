sound is a sense. a sense that we have. <br><br>

seeing sound through numbers. frequencies as numbers as sound. <br><br>

//how that happened- a short personal history of my search for sound//<br>
music is an encoded language. It has notes and scales and things I dont understand. It starts by building from zero mostly. there is nothing.  and then appers a sound. Pluck a string, press a keyboard key, hit a drum - all very clean and sophesticated - frequencies are produced.  and from there on - add more frequencies, change them- create a sequence - with ups and downs and layers.  that is the syntax of most music.  it is additive. it has a language based on what frequencies are pleasent to the human ear.  The problem with music and me is that I cannot comprehend the difference between one tone and another. I'm tone-deaf.  I can hear sound.  i like different kinds of sounds.  And so, with my sense of sound and a tool to play with sound and numbers - I'm exploring and finding myself in deep waters. <br>
