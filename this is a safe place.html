<body>hi yashas, marialaura and anyone else who happens to be here. <br>
<br>
// this space is a scratchpad. hope you will not get bored. 
<br><br>
// this network of webpages (which will grow more tangled with time) is isolated. so that you wont be thrown out of this experience in a click. All the links to refrences, which are doors to the outside network, or internet, are in refrences and notes at the end of each page. the links within the pages lead you to pages that I have made (or not yet made). //
<br><br><br><br><br>
enter <a href="main page with two urlsnowsee2.html">here</a>. :-)
